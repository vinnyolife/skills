# Browserbase Skills

A set of skills for enabling **[Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview)** to work with Browserbase through browser automation and the official `bb` CLI.

## Skills

This plugin includes the following skills (see `skills/` for details):

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [browser](skills/browser/SKILL.md) | Automate web browser interactions via CLI commands — supports remote Browserbase sessions with anti-bot stealth, CAPTCHA solving, and residential proxies |
| [browserbase-cli](skills/browserbase-cli/SKILL.md) | Use the official `bb` CLI for Browserbase Functions and platform API workflows including sessions, projects, contexts, extensions, fetch, and dashboard |
| [functions](skills/functions/SKILL.md) | Deploy serverless browser automation to Browserbase cloud using the `bb` CLI |
| [site-debugger](skills/site-debugger/SKILL.md) | Diagnose and fix failing browser automations — analyzes bot detection, selectors, timing, auth, and captchas, then generates a tested site playbook |
| [browser-trace](skills/browser-trace/SKILL.md) | Capture a full DevTools-protocol trace (CDP firehose, screenshots, DOM dumps) alongside any browser automation, then bisect the stream into per-page searchable buckets |
| [safe-browser](skills/safe-browser/SKILL.md) | Build local Claude Agent SDK browser agents whose only browser capability is a CDP-gated `safe_browser` tool with domain allowlist enforcement |
| [bb-usage](skills/bb-usage/SKILL.md) | Show Browserbase usage stats, session analytics, and cost forecasts in a terminal dashboard |
| [cookie-sync](skills/cookie-sync/SKILL.md) | Sync cookies from local Chrome to a Browserbase persistent context so the browse CLI can access authenticated sites |
| [fetch](skills/fetch/SKILL.md) | Fetch HTML or JSON from static pages without a browser session — inspect status codes, headers, follow redirects |
| [search](skills/search/SKILL.md) | Search the web and return structured results (titles, URLs, metadata) without a browser session |
| [ui-test](skills/ui-test/SKILL.md) | AI-powered adversarial UI testing — analyzes git diffs to test changes, or explores the full app to find bugs |

## Installation

To install the skill to popular coding agents:

```bash
$ npx skills add browserbase/skills
```

### Claude Code

On Claude Code, to add the marketplace, simply run:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add browserbase/skills
```

Then install the plugin:

```bash
/plugin install browse@browserbase
```

If you prefer the manual interface:
1. On Claude Code, type `/plugin`
2. Select option `3. Add marketplace`
3. Enter the marketplace source: `browserbase/skills`
4. Press enter to select the `browse` plugin
5. Hit enter again to `Install now`
6. **Restart Claude Code** for changes to take effect

## Usage

Once installed, you can ask Claude to browse or use the Browserbase CLI:
- *"Go to Hacker News, get the top post comments, and summarize them "*
- *"QA test http://localhost:3000 and report any bugs you find"*
- *"Fetch the latest pricing from example.com/pricing"*
- *"Search for recent news about browser automation tools"*

> **Personal note:** I mostly use the `browser` and `fetch` skills day-to-day. The `cookie-sync` skill is super handy for sites that require login — run it once and you're good to go for subsequent sessions.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- A [Browserbase](https://browserbase.com) account with an API key set as `BROWSERBASE_API_KEY`
- The `bb` CLI installed globally (`npm install -g @browserbasehq/bb`) for CLI-dependent skills
